# PDF-mini-Libary
my first project on GitHub, and an honors project in class.
#I made this for Principles of Computer Science II at GSU
#was new to java and hadn't learned about the magic of seperating your classes/methods from main file
#sorry the code is a thousand lines, this slows it down tremendously
